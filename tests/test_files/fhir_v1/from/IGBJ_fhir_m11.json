The study consists of a screening period; treatment period 1 (Period 1); washout period; treatment period 2 (Period 2); follow-up period. Figure IGBJ.1 illustrates the study design. Prior to the study drug administration on Period 1 Day 1, patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence (either LY900018 in Period 1 and IMG in Period 2, or vice versa).</p><p>Safety data will be reviewed after the first 6 patients (regardless of type of diabetes) are administered LY900018 in Period 2, and the remaining patients will be dosed after confirmation of the safety. The investigator and Lilly clinical research physician (CRP) or scientist will review available safety data, including AEs, SAEs, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory tests, from these patients after they complete Period 2 Day 1. If no clinically significant safety findings for treatment or study procedure are noted, the remaining patients will be dosed.</p><p>In each treatment period, patients will undergo a procedure to induce hypoglycemia using IV insulin infusion and serial blood sampling will be conducted to monitor bedside PG for safety. The insulin infusion will be stopped once the PG level reaches &lt;60 mg/dL and approximately 5 minutes later patients will be administered either 3 mg LY900018 or 1 mg IMG (GlucaGen). Serial blood sampling will be performed for glucagon (for pharmacokinetics [PK]) and PG (for pharmacodynamics [PD]) concentration measurements immediately before and up to 4 hours following the administration of glucagon. In each period, patients will remain in the CRU for at least 6 hours after glucagon administration. All patients will receive a carbohydrate-rich meal prior to discharge. Patients may stay longer as needed, at the discretion of the investigator.</p></div>"

Use of sulfonylurea and glinide by patients with T2DM may also cause hypoglycemia. Depending on the severity, hypoglycemia causes physical symptoms ranging from weakness, dizziness, and sweating progressing to blurred vision, behavioral changes, progressing to unconsciousness, seizures, and coma, and possibly to death (American Diabetes Association 2017). When emergency services are available in a timely manner, intravenous (IV) glucose supplementation is also an effective treatment. Glucagon for injection is a globally available product currently indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, and is another important treatment option outside of a clinical setting for people who try to rescue patients with severe hypoglycemia. However, for people without enough medical training, the multi-step reconstitution of glucagon and injection procedure would be complex and daunting with substantial risk of errors (Polonsky et al. 2016). Therefore the needle-free and easy-to-administer formulation of glucagon is desired for patients who have a risk of severe hypoglycemia related to anti-diabetes treatments. LY900018 is a powder formulation of synthetic human glucagon in a user-friendly, single-use, nasal dosing  device which delivers 3 mg glucagon powder. Patients do not need to inhale, as the drug is absorbed from the nasal cavity.</p><p>Three clinical trials using LY900018 have been completed in non-Japanese adults with T1DM and T2DM: Study IGBC, Study I8R-MC-IGBA (IGBA), and an actual use study (Study I8R-MC-B002 [B002]). Studies IGBC and IGBA demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy between 3 mg LY900018 and 1 mg injectable glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adult patients with T1DM only (Study IGBA) or patients with T2DM and T1DM (IGBC). Study B002 was an actual use study that evaluated the effectiveness of 3 mg LY900018 administered by a trained caregiver to patients with T1DM experiencing moderate to severe hypoglycemia in a real-world environment of work and home. Study B002 demonstrated that 96% of moderate to severe hypoglycemic events were resolved within 30 minutes. Finally, 2 trials were conducted in pediatric patients with T1DM: Study I8R-MC-IGBB (IGBB) and Study I8R-MC-B001 (B001). Studies IGBB and B001 demonstrated effectiveness in rescuing pediatric patients from hypoglycemia.</p><p>All adult diabetic patients in the 2 inpatient clinical trials (Studies IGBA and IGBC) underwent hypoglycemia induction through IV insulin under close clinical supervision and were administered either LY900018 or injectable glucagon.</p><p>Patients fully recovered from hypoglycemia without additional actions to increase glucose level. Specifically, in Study IGBC, at 30 minutes after glucagon dosing, 98.7% (74 out of 75 patients) of LY900018 and 100% (75 out of 75) of IMG-treated patients achieved treatment success (defined as an increase in PG to &gt;70 mg/dL or an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir). The nadir is defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration. The LY900018-treated patient who did not meet the above criteria did achieve both PG &gt;70 mg/dL and an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir at 40 minutes after dosing. Furthermore, the mean time to treatment success in participants with nadir glucose &lt;50 mg/dL were 16 minutes in the LY900018 treatment arm and 13 minutes in the IMG treatment arm, respectively (Rickels et al. 2016)</p></div>"

The procedure of insulin-induced hypoglycemia targeting nadir glucose around 50 mg/dL is adopted from a previously completed trial, specifically Study IGBC, which demonstrated the safe use of this method. This is an inpatient procedure in which the patients will be under constant supervision of the clinical research unit (CRU) staff with frequent glucose monitoring. Safety provisions have been considered in that IV glucose will be administered if the patient experiences signs and symptoms of severe hypoglycemia and gauged to require intervention during the experimental procedure, at the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>Potential risks associated with LY900018, derived from the known risks of currently existing injected glucagon therapy and from the safety profile observed from clinical trials conducted for LY900018, include nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, increased blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, headache, dysgeusia, and nasal or ocular events (Glucagon G Novo for Injection Package Insert, 2016; Glucagon G Novo for Injection Interview Form, 2015; GLUCAGON for Injection ITO Package Insert, 2016; GLUCAGON for Injection ITO Interview Form, 2016).</p><p>Nausea and Vomiting: Glucagon therapy, including LY900018, may cause nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Allergic Reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with glucagon therapy, including LY900018. Patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to injectable glucagon, or LY900018 or any of its excipients will be excluded from all clinical studies.</p><p>Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Glucagon exerts positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. A temporary increase in both BP and heart rate may occur after the administration of glucagon, including LY900018.</p><p>Headache and Dysgeusia: Use of LY900018 may cause headache and altered taste.</p><p>Nasal Symptoms: Use of LY900018 may cause a variety of nasal symptoms, such as runny nose, stuffy nose, nasal discomfort, cough, and sneezing.</p><p>Ocular Symptoms: Use of LY900018 may cause a variety of ocular symptoms, such as watery eyes, redness of eyes, and itchy eyes.</p><p>No additional potential risks of LY900018 were identified in preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicity studies (Reno et al. 2015).</p></div>"

The 3-mg dose provides more consistent clinical efficacy compared to the 2-mg dose and is similarly well tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients. The 1-mg dose of IMG is selected as the approved dose for the rescue treatment of hypoglycemia in Japan.

The 3-mg dose provides more consistent clinical efficacy compared to the 2-mg dose and is similarly well tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients. The 1-mg dose of IMG is selected as the approved dose for the rescue treatment of hypoglycemia in Japan.

(This has also been called unclassifiable hypoglycemia.)</li></ul><p>Documented Clinically Significant Hypoglycemia (Level 2)</p><p>Similar criterion as for Level 1, except for threshold PG &lt; 54 mg/dL</p><ul><li>Level 2 documented symptomatic hypoglycemia </li><li>Level 2 documented asymptomatic hypoglycemia </li><li>Level 2 documented unspecified hypoglycemia</li></ul><p>Severe Hypoglycemia (Level 3)</p><p>Patient had altered mental status and could not assist in their own care, was semiconscious or unconscious, or experienced coma with or without seizures, and the assistance of another person was to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of PG concentration to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration (PG \u2264 70 mg/dL)</p><p>Other Hypoglycemia</p><ul><li>Nocturnal hypoglycemia: Any documented hypoglycemic event (including severe hypoglycemia) that occurs at night and presumably during sleep. This is captured as hypoglycemia that occurs between bedtime and waking. This definition is more useful than the commonly used approximately 00:00 to 06:00 definition which does not take patients\u2019 individual sleep times into consideration, and is consistent with the American Diabetes Association recommendations of reporting events that occur during sleep (ADA 2005). It is also important to collect the actual time when a hypoglycemic event occurred to allow further characterization of hypoglycemia timing (eg, to allow analysis of frequency of events occurring across a 24-hour clock). Nocturnal hypoglycemia may occur at severity Levels 1, 2, or 3.</li><li>Relative hypoglycemia (also referred to as pseudohypoglycemia [Seaquist et al. 2013]): An event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia occur, that does not require the assistance of another person and is accompanied by PG \u2265 70 mg/dL. The PG value of patients with chronically poor glycemic control can decrease so rapidly that patients may report symptoms of hypoglycemia before their PG concentration falls below 70 mg/dL. Events with PG \u2264 70 mg/dL should not be categorized as relative hypoglycemia. Evaluation and statistical analysis of this category is optional. However, if a patient reports a relative hypoglycemia event  where assistance from another person was received or the patient experienced significant symptoms, the study team should clarify the circumstances to ensure the event is not a severe hypoglycemia event, and report it appropriately.</li><li>Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: Symptoms of hypoglycemia were present, but PG measurement was not reported. </li><li>Overall (or total) hypoglycemia: This optional category combines most cases of hypoglycemia (documented hypoglycemia and probable symptomatic hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia). It does not include relative hypoglycemia. Nocturnal and severe hypoglycemia are special cases of documented or probable hypoglycemia. If an event of hypoglycemia falls into multiple subcategories, that event should only be counted once in the category of overall (or total) hypoglycemia. </li></ul><p>Hypoglycemia episodes will be recorded on specific CRF pages. Only severe hypoglycemic episodes will be reported separately as AEs. If a hypoglycemic event meets the criteria of severe, it needs to be recorded as serious in the CRF (that is, recorded as an SAE). In the case of a hypoglycemic event (other than severe), the actual glucose value, if measured, should be recorded in the CRF, with any treatments administered, and not be recorded as an AE. Cases of hypoglycemia may be treated with foods rich in carbohydrate such as fruit, juice, skimmed milk, or energy bars. All episodes of hypoglycemia that are determined by the investigator to constitute severe hypoglycemia according to the definition above should be reported as SAEs.</p></div>"

Treatment success is defined as either an increase in PG to \u226570 mg/dL or an increase of \u226520 mg/dL from PG nadir within 30 minutes after receiving study treatment. The nadir is defined as the minimum PG concentration at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration.</p><p>The primary analysis will be a treatment group comparison of the primary outcome. The percentage of treatment successes in each treatment group and the difference in percentages will be computed. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be obtained from the 1-sample mean of the paired differences in primary outcome (1=outcome observed; 0=outcome not observed) across 2 treatment visits. Non-inferiority of LY900018 will be declared if the upper limit of a 2-sided 95% CI constructed on the difference in percentages (IMG - LY900018) is less than the NIM of 10%.</p><p>Primary efficacy analysis will only include patients who complete both treatment visits with evaluable primary outcome.
