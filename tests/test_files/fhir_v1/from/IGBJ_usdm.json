            "text": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Hypoglycemia is a common complication in all patients with T1DM and some patients with T2DM who use insulin to reduce blood glucose levels. Use of sulfonylurea and glinide by patients with T2DM may also cause hypoglycemia. Depending on the severity, hypoglycemia causes physical symptoms ranging from weakness, dizziness, and sweating progressing to blurred vision, behavioral changes, progressing to unconsciousness, seizures, and coma, and possibly to death (American Diabetes Association 2017). When emergency services are available in a timely manner, intravenous (IV) glucose supplementation is also an effective treatment. Glucagon for injection is a globally available product currently indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, and is another important treatment option outside of a clinical setting for people who try to rescue patients with severe hypoglycemia. However, for people without enough medical training, the multi-step reconstitution of glucagon and injection procedure would be complex and daunting with substantial risk of errors (Polonsky et al. 2016). Therefore the needle-free and easy-to-administer formulation of glucagon is desired for patients who have a risk of severe hypoglycemia related to anti-diabetes treatments. LY900018 is a powder formulation of synthetic human glucagon in a user-friendly, single-use, nasal dosing  device which delivers 3 mg glucagon powder. Patients do not need to inhale, as the drug is absorbed from the nasal cavity.</p><p>Three clinical trials using LY900018 have been completed in non-Japanese adults with T1DM and T2DM: Study IGBC, Study I8R-MC-IGBA (IGBA), and an actual use study (Study I8R-MC-B002 [B002]). Studies IGBC and IGBA demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy between 3 mg LY900018 and 1 mg injectable glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adult patients with T1DM only (Study IGBA) or patients with T2DM and T1DM (IGBC). Study B002 was an actual use study that evaluated the effectiveness of 3 mg LY900018 administered by a trained caregiver to patients with T1DM experiencing moderate to severe hypoglycemia in a real-world environment of work and home. Study B002 demonstrated that 96% of moderate to severe hypoglycemic events were resolved within 30 minutes. Finally, 2 trials were conducted in pediatric patients with T1DM: Study I8R-MC-IGBB (IGBB) and Study I8R-MC-B001 (B001). Studies IGBB and B001 demonstrated effectiveness in rescuing pediatric patients from hypoglycemia.</p><p>All adult diabetic patients in the 2 inpatient clinical trials (Studies IGBA and IGBC) underwent hypoglycemia induction through IV insulin under close clinical supervision and were administered either LY900018 or injectable glucagon.</p><p>Patients fully recovered from hypoglycemia without additional actions to increase glucose level. Specifically, in Study IGBC, at 30 minutes after glucagon dosing, 98.7% (74 out of 75 patients) of LY900018 and 100% (75 out of 75) of IMG-treated patients achieved treatment success (defined as an increase in PG to &gt;70 mg/dL or an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir). The nadir is defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration. The LY900018-treated patient who did not meet the above criteria did achieve both PG &gt;70 mg/dL and an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir at 40 minutes after dosing. Furthermore, the mean time to treatment success in participants with nadir glucose &lt;50 mg/dL were 16 minutes in the LY900018 treatment arm and 13 minutes in the IMG treatment arm, respectively (Rickels et al. 2016)</p></div>",

            "text": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Hypoglycemia is a common complication in all patients with T1DM and some patients with T2DM who use insulin to reduce blood glucose levels. Use of sulfonylurea and glinide by patients with T2DM may also cause hypoglycemia. Depending on the severity, hypoglycemia causes physical symptoms ranging from weakness, dizziness, and sweating progressing to blurred vision, behavioral changes, progressing to unconsciousness, seizures, and coma, and possibly to death (American Diabetes Association 2017). When emergency services are available in a timely manner, intravenous (IV) glucose supplementation is also an effective treatment. Glucagon for injection is a globally available product currently indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, and is another important treatment option outside of a clinical setting for people who try to rescue patients with severe hypoglycemia. However, for people without enough medical training, the multi-step reconstitution of glucagon and injection procedure would be complex and daunting with substantial risk of errors (Polonsky et al. 2016). Therefore the needle-free and easy-to-administer formulation of glucagon is desired for patients who have a risk of severe hypoglycemia related to anti-diabetes treatments. LY900018 is a powder formulation of synthetic human glucagon in a user-friendly, single-use, nasal dosing  device which delivers 3 mg glucagon powder. Patients do not need to inhale, as the drug is absorbed from the nasal cavity.</p><p>Three clinical trials using LY900018 have been completed in non-Japanese adults with T1DM and T2DM: Study IGBC, Study I8R-MC-IGBA (IGBA), and an actual use study (Study I8R-MC-B002 [B002]). Studies IGBC and IGBA demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy between 3 mg LY900018 and 1 mg injectable glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adult patients with T1DM only (Study IGBA) or patients with T2DM and T1DM (IGBC). Study B002 was an actual use study that evaluated the effectiveness of 3 mg LY900018 administered by a trained caregiver to patients with T1DM experiencing moderate to severe hypoglycemia in a real-world environment of work and home. Study B002 demonstrated that 96% of moderate to severe hypoglycemic events were resolved within 30 minutes. Finally, 2 trials were conducted in pediatric patients with T1DM: Study I8R-MC-IGBB (IGBB) and Study I8R-MC-B001 (B001). Studies IGBB and B001 demonstrated effectiveness in rescuing pediatric patients from hypoglycemia.</p><p>All adult diabetic patients in the 2 inpatient clinical trials (Studies IGBA and IGBC) underwent hypoglycemia induction through IV insulin under close clinical supervision and were administered either LY900018 or injectable glucagon.</p><p>Patients fully recovered from hypoglycemia without additional actions to increase glucose level. Specifically, in Study IGBC, at 30 minutes after glucagon dosing, 98.7% (74 out of 75 patients) of LY900018 and 100% (75 out of 75) of IMG-treated patients achieved treatment success (defined as an increase in PG to &gt;70 mg/dL or an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir). The nadir is defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration. The LY900018-treated patient who did not meet the above criteria did achieve both PG &gt;70 mg/dL and an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir at 40 minutes after dosing. Furthermore, the mean time to treatment success in participants with nadir glucose &lt;50 mg/dL were 16 minutes in the LY900018 treatment arm and 13 minutes in the IMG treatment arm, respectively (Rickels et al. 2016)</p></div>",

This is captured as hypoglycemia that occurs between bedtime and waking. This definition is more useful than the commonly used approximately 00:00 to 06:00 definition which does not take patients\u2019 individual sleep times into consideration, and is consistent with the American Diabetes Association recommendations of reporting events that occur during sleep (ADA 2005). It is also important to collect the actual time when a hypoglycemic event occurred to allow further characterization of hypoglycemia timing (eg, to allow analysis of frequency of events occurring across a 24-hour clock). Nocturnal hypoglycemia may occur at severity Levels 1, 2, or 3.</li><li>Relative hypoglycemia (also referred to as pseudohypoglycemia [Seaquist et al. 2013]): An event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia occur, that does not require the assistance of another person and is accompanied by PG \u2265 70 mg/dL. The PG value of patients with chronically poor glycemic control can decrease so rapidly that patients may report symptoms of hypoglycemia before their PG concentration falls below 70 mg/dL. Events with PG \u2264 70 mg/dL should not be categorized as relative hypoglycemia. Evaluation and statistical analysis of this category is optional. However, if a patient reports a relative hypoglycemia event  where assistance from another person was received or the patient experienced significant symptoms, the study team should clarify the circumstances to ensure the event is not a severe hypoglycemia event, and report it appropriately.</li><li>Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: Symptoms of hypoglycemia were present, but PG measurement was not reported. </li><li>Overall (or total) hypoglycemia: This optional category combines most cases of hypoglycemia (documented hypoglycemia and probable symptomatic hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia). It does not include relative hypoglycemia. Nocturnal and severe hypoglycemia are special cases of documented or probable hypoglycemia. If an event of hypoglycemia falls into multiple subcategories, that event should only be counted once in the category of overall (or total) hypoglycemia. </li></ul><p>Hypoglycemia episodes will be recorded on specific CRF pages. Only severe hypoglycemic episodes will be reported separately as AEs. If a hypoglycemic event meets the criteria of severe, it needs to be recorded as serious in the CRF (that is, recorded as an SAE). In the case of a hypoglycemic event (other than severe), the actual glucose value, if measured, should be recorded in the CRF, with any treatments administered, and not be recorded as an AE. Cases of hypoglycemia may be treated with foods rich in carbohydrate such as fruit, juice, skimmed milk, or energy bars. All episodes of hypoglycemia that are determined by the investigator to constitute severe hypoglycemia according to the definition above should be reported as SAEs.</p></div>",

To interpret the results of immunogenicity, a venous blood sample may be collected at the same time points to determine the concentrations of glucagon. All samples for immunogenicity should be taken predose when applicable.</p><p>In the event of drug hypersensitivity reactions (immediate or non-immediate), additional immunogenicity samples will be collected as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the resolution of the event, and 30 days following the event. A PK sample may be collected at these same time points(s) if warranted and agreed upon between both the investigator and sponsor.</p><p>Treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies (TE ADA) are defined in Section 10.3.6. If the immunogenicity titer at the last scheduled assessment or discontinuation visit meets the definition of treatment emergent, then, at the discretion of the sponsor, patients should be called back to the site for follow-up immunogenicity assessment(s). Samples for immunogenicity should be collected every 12 weeks until the titer returns to baseline (ie, returns to within a single 2-fold dilution of the baseline titer) or until 1 year after the last dose of study treatment. A PK sample may be collected at the follow-up immunogenicity assessment(s) if warranted and agreed upon between both the investigator and sponsor. Every attempt should be made to contact patients for the follow-up immunogenicity assessment; however, if patients are unwilling or unable to return for the visit, this is not considered a protocol violation.</p><p>Instructions for the collection and handling of blood samples will be provided by the sponsor. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sampling will be recorded.</p><p>Immunogenicity will be assessed by a validated assay designed to detect antidrug antibodies (ADA) in the presence of glucagon at a laboratory approved by the sponsor. Antibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their ability to neutralize the activity of glucagon.</p><p>Samples will be retained for a maximum of 15 years after the last patient visit, or for a shorter period if local regulations and ethical review boards (ERBs) allow, at a facility selected by the sponsor. The duration allows the sponsor to respond to future regulatory requests related to LY900018. Any samples remaining after 15 years will be destroyed. &gt;</p></div>",

If a hypoglycemic event meets the criteria of severe, it needs to be recorded as serious in the CRF (that is, recorded as an SAE). In the case of a hypoglycemic event (other than severe), the actual glucose value, if measured, should be recorded in the CRF, with any treatments administered, and not be recorded as an AE. Cases of hypoglycemia may be treated with foods rich in carbohydrate such as fruit, juice, skimmed milk, or energy bars. All episodes of hypoglycemia that are determined by the investigator to constitute severe hypoglycemia according to the definition above should be reported as SAEs.</p></div>",

If a patient receives a glucose infusion to prevent the progression to severe hypoglycemia (see Section 9.2.4), data after IV glucose infusion may be excluded from the efficacy and PD analyses. Details will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the SAP and/or in the clinical study report. Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. Study results may be pooled with the results of other studies for population PK analysis purposes to avoid issues with post-hoc analyses and incomplete disclosures of analyses.</p></div>",
