TYK2 plays an important role in JAK-STAT-mediated signal transduction of various ligands, including IL-23, IL-12 and, in particular, type I IFN (Jo et al. 2022). Deucravacitinib has previously been tested as a treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in large clinical trials offering promising results (Armstrong et al. 2022; Strober et al. 2022).</p><p>Lichen planus is a type I IFN-mediated inflammatory skin disease that can affect the mucous membranes as well as the skin and may represent a severe burden in patients' lives (Boch et al. 2021). Preliminary studies show that TYK2 is highly expressed in lichen planus skin lesions. Thus, selective TYK2 inhibitors may represent a promising therapeutic concept for lichen planus, but a controlled, double-blind clinical trial to support this hypothesis is missing.</p><p>5.1 Background</p><p>5.1.1 Scientific Rationale &amp; Hypothesis</p><p>Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the skin and/or mucous membranes. Lichen planus patients, especially those with oral manifestations in form of ulcers, can suffer from severe discomfort, itching and may experience a significant reduction in their quality of life. Despite the therapeutic need, no specific drug has been approved to date (Boch et al. 2021).</p><p>The disease is characterized by a typical histological pattern called interface dermatitis (ID), which is defined by the presence of necroptotic keratinocytes and an epitheliotropic cytotoxic lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction (Sugerman et al. 2000).</p><p>Type-I-interferon (IFN) signaling plays a crucial role in inflammatory skin diseases featuring ID as these IFNs induce the expression of proinflammatory chemokines (e.g. CXCL9 and CXCL10) (Wenzel und T\u00fcting 2008; Wenzel et al. 2006). The major pathway utilized by IFNs is the JAK-STAT pathway. Upon binding of type-IIFNs to their receptor, downstream JAK1 and TYK2 are activated and mediate IFN-associated proinflammatory gene expression. In LP, the expressed chemokines attract effector cells to lesional tissues that exert cytotoxic effects especially towards basal keratinocytes with subsequent cytokine release, leading to a continuous \"self-recruitment\" as a hallmark of chronic inflammation (Wenzel et al. 2006).</p><p>The described insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underline the importance of the JAK1/TYK2- STAT pathway and its potential as a therapeutic target. TYK2-inhibitors aim to prevent JAK1/TYK2-/STATmediated signal transduction, thereby leading to reduced chemokine expression by a very unique way of allosteric inhibition of TYK2 - compared to other JAK-family-inhibitors - via binding to the regulatory domain. Due to this unique mechanism, potentially drug-limiting side effects could be prevented (Chimalakonda et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2021).</p><p>5.1.2 Deucravacitinib</p><p>According to BMS IB version 09 for deucravacitinib</p><p>Deucravacitinib is a potent, highly selective small molecule inhibitor of TYK2. TYK2 is a member of the JAK family and interacts with both JAK1 and JAK2 each as a dimer to ensure JAK-STAT mediated signal transduction of several ligands such as IL-23, IL-12, and type I IFN.</p><p>Unlike other inhibitors of JAK family members (JAK1/JAK2/JAK3), the selective TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib has a specific binding mechanism that accounts for its high selectivity over the other JAK family members. Deucravacitinib binds to the regulatory pseudokinase domain of TYK2 and stabilizes an inhibitory interaction between the pseudokinase and catalytic domains of the enzyme. This leads to blockade of receptor-mediated activation of TYK2 and consequent inhibition of downstream functions in cells and in vivo. The binding mode of deucravacitinib exploits the unique structural features of the TYK2 pseudokinase domain compared to other kinases and pseudokinases to achieve high biochemical and cellular functional selectivity. This approach distinguishes deucravacitinib from non-selective inhibitors of the JAK kinase family that target the highly conserved active site of the kinase domain.</p><p>The aims of our study are as follows:</p><ul><li>Deucravacitinib reduces the objective clinical symptoms/disease activity of lichen planus. </li><li>Deucravacitinib alleviates the subjective symptoms of lichen planus and thus improves the quality of life of lichen planus patients. </li><li>Deucravacitinib reduces the inflammatory signature in blood and skin samples from lichen planus patients (mRNA evaluation).</li></ul></div>"

Since there is evidence for an immunomodulating effect additionally to its unique binding mechanism deucravacitinib is currently under investigation as targeted therapy of several other diseases such as psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis (NCT04613518) (Mease et al. 2022; Danese und Peyrin-Biroulet 2021; Morand et al. 2022). The described side effects (e.g., upper respiratory tract infections, herpes simplex, folliculitis) are most likely due to its immunosuppressive effect (antiviral immune response is mediated via type-I-IFN-induced TYK2/JAK1-signal transduction, which is inhibited by deucravacitinib). Lichen planus is a disease associated with severe impairment of life quality. Current therapeutic options are mostly based on empirical data (small studies, case reports) and are limited by side effects, decreasing efficacy, resistance, or restricted use, thus there is a great medical need for new therapeutic strategies. Based on the specific binding mechanism and recent data from previous studies, typical JAK inhibitor-related, potentially therapy-limiting side effects such as thrombocytopenia or anemia are not expected. Therefore, investigation of deucravacitinib in lichen planus patients under strict medical supervision as performed in the present study (in particular to intercept upcoming infections as soon as possible), seems to be justifiable. In conclusion, the overall assessment of the benefitrisk ratio in the DEUCRALIP study justifies the conduct of the present study.</p></div>"

Since there is evidence for an immunomodulating effect additionally to its unique binding mechanism deucravacitinib is currently under investigation as targeted therapy of several other diseases such as psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis (NCT04613518) (Mease et al. 2022; Danese und Peyrin-Biroulet 2021; Morand et al. 2022). The described side effects (e.g., upper respiratory tract infections, herpes simplex, folliculitis) are most likely due to its immunosuppressive effect (antiviral immune response is mediated via type-I-IFN-induced TYK2/JAK1-signal transduction, which is inhibited by deucravacitinib). Lichen planus is a disease associated with severe impairment of life quality. Current therapeutic options are mostly based on empirical data (small studies, case reports) and are limited by side effects, decreasing efficacy, resistance, or restricted use, thus there is a great medical need for new therapeutic strategies. Based on the specific binding mechanism and recent data from previous studies, typical JAK inhibitor-related, potentially therapy-limiting side effects such as thrombocytopenia or anemia are not expected. Therefore, investigation of deucravacitinib in lichen planus patients under strict medical supervision as performed in the present study (in particular to intercept upcoming infections as soon as possible), seems to be justifiable.

In two large phase II and III trials in psoriasis vulgaris (POETYK-Pso I &amp; POETYK-Pso II), deucravacitinib showed significant efficacy and good tolerability (Armstrong et al. 2022; Strober et al. 2022). In addition, TYK2 inhibitors feature a specific binding mechanism to the JAK enzyme that differs from that of other JAK inhibitors and is therefore considered particularly selective. Side effects currently observed with other JAK inhibitors have not been described for selective TYK2 inhibitors. TYK2 is known to mediate intracellular signal transduction of type-I-IFNs. Since lichen planus is a type-I-IFN-mediated disease and TYK2 is strongly expressed in lichen planus skin lesions, an efficacy of TYK2 inhibitors can be assumed - based on the described patho-physiological principles.</p></div>"

A participant discontinued from the study treatment may not necessarily be discontinued from the study as further study procedures or follow-up may be performed (safety), if planned in the study protocol. The Investigator should make all efforts to ensure that the participants remain in the study to ensure a proper safety follow-up and medical care if needed and document the reason for participant discontinuation of study treatment.</p><p>Information relative to premature discontinuation of the study drug will be documented (primary reason) in the eCRF. The Investigator will document which of the following reasons was responsible for discontinuation of study drug:</p><ul><li>AE (incl. SAE)</li><li>Death </li><li>Significant violation of the protocol </li><li>Non-adherence to treatment regimen </li><li>Physician Decision </li><li>Pregnancy </li><li>Other reason (non-AE) </li><li>Lost to follow-up </li><li>Withdrawal of Consent by Participant </li><li>Trail Termination by Sponsor </li><li>Other (specify) </li></ul><p>Subjects who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see Section 12.6 for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug.</p><p>Subjects who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.</p><p>If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of the Schedules of Assessments including different options for follow-up and collection of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, or from options not involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient\u2019s medical records.</p><p>If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 12.1.</p><p>If a dose is missed by a subject, it must be taken as soon as possible and the investigator has to be contacted. If the dose is interrupted either by the subject for 72 consecutive hours, the subject must be excluded from the study. If the dose is interrupted for a shorter period of time (less than 72 consecutive hours), the study can be continued. If the dose is interrupted at several intervals for less than 72 consecutive hours, it is at the discretion of the investigator to decide whether the subject must be excluded from or can continue the study. An investigator can temporarily interrupt dosing for up to a maximum of 72 consecutive hours for a subject, for safety reasons or while monitoring abnormal laboratory tests if the investigator judges that this is necessary. The investigator should use their judgement with regard to unscheduled visits/laboratory/clinical assessments required to monitor the subject during this timeframe. If within this timeframe the investigator judges that it is safe to restart dosing, then the subject may restart investigational product. If the investigator judges that it is not safe to restart dosing within this timeframe then the subject must be permanently discontinued from treatment, have an EOS visit and enter the safety follow-up period.</p><p>If the study was not terminated by the subject or by the investigator due to protocol violations by the subject (e.g. lack of compliance), the patient can participate in the study a second time. This is particularly the case if the study was interrupted due to safety issues such as infections, including but not limited to COVID-19. As soon as it is foreseeable that the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be met again (e.g. last intake of deucravacitinib longer than 8 weeks prior to study inclusion/day 1), a new screening can be scheduled for the subject. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, the subject can be re-enrolled in the study.</p><p>Participants who are randomized to treatment but do not receive the first study drug on the same day will be permitted to return for the first IMP administration on Day 1 if within the 28-day screening window. Participants who are randomized to treatment but do not receive the first study drug will be discontinued from study treatment and the study, with the exception of any participant being followed for an SAE.</p></div>"

In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.</p><p>If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of the Schedules of Assessments including different options for follow-up and collection of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, or from options not involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient\u2019s medical records.</p><p>If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 12.1.</p><p>If a dose is missed by a subject, it must be taken as soon as possible and the investigator has to be contacted. If the dose is interrupted either by the subject for 72 consecutive hours, the subject must be excluded from the study. If the dose is interrupted for a shorter period of time (less than 72 consecutive hours), the study can be continued. If the dose is interrupted at several intervals for less than 72 consecutive hours, it is at the discretion of the investigator to decide whether the subject must be excluded from or can continue the study. An investigator can temporarily interrupt dosing for up to a maximum of 72 consecutive hours for a subject, for safety reasons or while monitoring abnormal laboratory tests if the investigator judges that this is necessary. The investigator should use their judgement with regard to unscheduled visits/laboratory/clinical assessments required to monitor the subject during this timeframe. If within this timeframe the investigator judges that it is safe to restart dosing, then the subject may restart investigational product. If the investigator judges that it is not safe to restart dosing within this timeframe then the subject must be permanently discontinued from treatment, have an EOS visit and enter the safety follow-up period.</p><p>If the study was not terminated by the subject or by the investigator due to protocol violations by the subject (e.g. lack of compliance), the patient can participate in the study a second time.

For instance, most recently, Tsoi et al. compared skin tapes with whole skin biopsies from psoriasis patients with and without skin lesions, as well as healthy controls. The group found that transcriptomic profiling of RNA isolated from taped, lesional psoriatic skin efficiently captured genes expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis and accurately detected active immunologic pathways in psoriasis compared with whole skin biopsies. They concluded that tape stripping, as a less invasive and safer method for measuring transcriptomic changes in inflamed skin, offers the opportunity to extend studies of pathomechanisms and biomarkers in skin to much larger patient cohorts than has previously been possible.</p></div>"

Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether \u201chospitalization\u201d occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious </li><li>In-patient stays without an underlying adverse event are not SAE (e.g.: elective in-patient treatment due to a pre-existing condition; inpatient admission for social reasons; admission to a rehabilitation clinic or hospice) </li><li>The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person\u2019s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption</li></ul><p>Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse, or potential DILI event as defined at 12.5.1.</p></div>"
