Participants will be screened for up to 28 days prior to first investigational product administration. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and will be residential for a single period of 17 days/16 nights. After randomization, participants will receive multiple oral doses of ASP8062 or placebo (2:1 ratio) on days 1 through 10. On day 10, all participants will also receive a single oral dose of morphine immediately after the ASP8062 or placebo dose followed by a 144-hour in-house blood sampling period. Scheduled safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments [Table 1]. Participants are to remain awake, seated or semirecumbent and avoid lying on either the left or right side for at least 4 hours postdose on days 9 and 10. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day 16 on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit. The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place 5 to 9 days after the day 16 pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at early discontinuation/termination from the study.</p></div>",

Participants will be screened for up to 28 days prior to first investigational product administration. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and will be residential for a single period of 17 days/16 nights. After randomization, participants will receive multiple oral doses of ASP8062 or placebo (2:1 ratio) on days 1 through 10. On day 10, all participants will also receive a single oral dose of morphine immediately after the ASP8062 or placebo dose followed by a 144-hour in-house blood sampling period. Scheduled safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments [Table 1]. Participants are to remain awake, seated or semirecumbent and avoid lying on either the left or right side for at least 4 hours postdose on days 9 and 10. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day 16 on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit. The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place 5 to 9 days after the day 16 pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at early discontinuation/termination from the study.</p></div>",

Side effects of opioids in general include respiratory depression, central nervous system depression and drowsiness, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, dependence, reduction of gastrointestinal motility, hepatitis with or without jaundice, allergic reactions, impairment in the ability to drive, orthostatic hypotension, elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure and intracholendochal pressure.</p><p>There is no expected benefit to the participants from the administration of morphine.</p><p>This will be the first study where a multiple daily oral dose of ASP8062 is administered in participants that will also be given morphine after the participants have reached near steady-state peak to trough exposures of ASP8062.

Morphine is metabolized by multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferases [De Gregori et al, 2012; Sato et al, 2012; Court et al, 2003; Projean et al, 2003]. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of ASP8062 with opioids is considered to be low. Potential interaction such as opioid effects on respiratory depression is theoretically possible because both ASP8062 and opioids are centrally active [Pattinson, 2008].</p><p>For future studies in opioid use disorder (OUD) patients, ASP8062 will be coadministered with opioids, including standard medication-assisted treatments such as buprenorphine/naloxone. Among opioid receptors, the \u00b5-receptor is considered to play a role in the decrease in the respiratory response to hypoxia, resulting in a decreased stimulus to breathe and the development of apnea [Schiller &amp; Mechanic, 2019]. ASP8062 has not been observed to directly interact with opioid receptor [study 8062-PH-9005] and the preclinical DDI study [study 8062-PH-9055] between ASP8062 and morphine, a full agonist for opioid \u00b5-receptor, failed to find any pharmacodynamic (i.e., respiratory depression) interaction including general condition. This clinical DDI/safety study will provide relevant safety (particularly for respiratory depression), tolerability and pharmacokinetic data in order to assess the potential risk of ASP8062 coadministered with morphine, a full agonist for opioid \u00b5-receptor to support future studies in this patient population. The study was designed particularly to investigate if ASP8062 has any additive effect on top of morphine by instituting the sensitive measure of end tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), using a single morphine dose slightly above the highest approved individual morphine dose, but presumably still allowing room to detect potential additive effects of ASP8062.</p><p>A randomized, participant- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, single sequence study was chosen to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ASP8062 alone and ASP8062 in combination with a single dose of morphine sulfate, a full \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist. Participants will be randomized to treatment to reduce selection bias. Participants and the investigator will both be blinded to treatment to reduce bias in the measurement of the primary safety endpoints. Given the long pharmacokinetic t\u00bd of ASP8062 (approximately 60 hours), a single sequence study was chosen.</p></div>",

ASP8062 is a crystal, which is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol.</p><p>An estimated 2.1 million Americans had an OUD in 2017 [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018]. Overdose deaths due to opioid use have skyrocketed to over 47600 in 2017 [Scholl et al, 2018]. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) data show that use of opioids can lead to neonatal abstinence syndrome [NIDA, 2019a] as well as the spread of infectious diseases like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis [NIDA, 2019b]. Medication assisted treatment with buprenorphine (with or without naloxone), methadone or naltrexone is the current standard of care, and has resulted in decreases in opioid use, overdose deaths, criminal activity and infectious disease transmission [Mattick et al, 2014; Schwartz et al, 2013; Mattick et al, 2009]. However, buprenorphine can induce withdrawal on first administration, has an overdose potential, induces withdrawal symptoms and a loss of tolerance on cessation, is also subject to abuse and diversion and can cause respiratory suppression. Buprenorphine\u2019s ceiling effect may limit its effectiveness in patients with ongoing opioid use [Bart, 2012].</p><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 5 (DSM-5) defines substance use disorders as a constellation of recurrent pathological cognitive, behavioral and physiological symptoms arising from the ongoing use of a substance. The DSM-5 has combined the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 4 categories of substance abuse and substance dependence under the single heading of substance use disorders, which is classified by severity based on the number of symptom criteria (out of a total of 11) that are met: mild (2 to 3 criteria), moderate (4 to 5 criteria) and severe (more than 6 criteria) [Hasin et al, 2013]. Different drugs produce different effects on the user, but important shared features include a dysregulation of brain reward pathways and an overactive brain stress system, which together reinforce use of the substance to achieve a pleasurable high, even if pursuing this high incurs great cost or negative consequences for the user.</p><p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter, activates 2 types of receptors: ionotropic GABA type A receptors [Olsen &amp; Sieghart, 2008] and metabotropic GABAB receptors [Bowery et al, 2002]. Studies with GABAergic drugs and drugs of abuse have indicated that the GABAB receptor mediates suppression of self-administration/craving across several drug modalities. Drugs triggering abuse act by enhancing dopamine release in the ventral tegmental, striatal, and prefrontal cortical areas of the brain. The effects of GABAergic compounds on decreasing drug self-administration and drug-seeking behavior act by either directly or indirectly decreasing dopamine release in the aforementioned brain areas [Filip et al, 2015]. GABAB agonists or PAMs have been found to attenuate opioid-, alcohol-, cocaine- and nicotine-seeking behavior [Augier et al, 2017; Vlachou et al, 2011; Franklin et al, 2009; Filip &amp; Frankowska, 2007; Paterson et al, 2004; Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2003b; Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2003a] and also attenuate the drugs of abuse-evoked changes during intracranial self-stimulation [Vlachou et al, 2011; Paterson et al, 2008; Slattery et al, 2005]. However, activation of GABAB receptors by orthosteric agonists such as baclofen induces side effects such as sedation, somnolence, excessive weakness, vertigo and cognitive impairment. The sedative properties of baclofen limits its potential widespread therapeutic utility [Dario &amp; Tomei, 2004]. Accordingly, activation of GABAB receptors by PAMs is one of the prioritized medication treatment approaches for NIDA in response to the opioid crisis [Rasmussen et al, 2019].</p><p>For information on the nonclinical and clinical data of ASP8062, please refer to the [Investigator\u2019s Brochure].</p></div>",

Buprenorphine\u2019s ceiling effect may limit its effectiveness in patients with ongoing opioid use [Bart, 2012].</p><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 5 (DSM-5) defines substance use disorders as a constellation of recurrent pathological cognitive, behavioral and physiological symptoms arising from the ongoing use of a substance. The DSM-5 has combined the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 4 categories of substance abuse and substance dependence under the single heading of substance use disorders, which is classified by severity based on the number of symptom criteria (out of a total of 11) that are met: mild (2 to 3 criteria), moderate (4 to 5 criteria) and severe (more than 6 criteria) [Hasin et al, 2013]. Different drugs produce different effects on the user, but important shared features include a dysregulation of brain reward pathways and an overactive brain stress system, which together reinforce use of the substance to achieve a pleasurable high, even if pursuing this high incurs great cost or negative consequences for the user.</p><p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter, activates 2 types of receptors: ionotropic GABA type A receptors [Olsen &amp; Sieghart, 2008] and metabotropic GABAB receptors [Bowery et al, 2002]. Studies with GABAergic drugs and drugs of abuse have indicated that the GABAB receptor mediates suppression of self-administration/craving across several drug modalities. Drugs triggering abuse act by enhancing dopamine release in the ventral tegmental, striatal, and prefrontal cortical areas of the brain. The effects of GABAergic compounds on decreasing drug self-administration and drug-seeking behavior act by either directly or indirectly decreasing dopamine release in the aforementioned brain areas [Filip et al, 2015]. GABAB agonists or PAMs have been found to attenuate opioid-, alcohol-, cocaine- and nicotine-seeking behavior [Augier et al, 2017; Vlachou et al, 2011; Franklin et al, 2009; Filip &amp; Frankowska, 2007; Paterson et al, 2004; Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2003b; Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2003a] and also attenuate the drugs of abuse-evoked changes during intracranial self-stimulation [Vlachou et al, 2011; Paterson et al, 2008; Slattery et al, 2005]. However, activation of GABAB receptors by orthosteric agonists such as baclofen induces side effects such as sedation, somnolence, excessive weakness, vertigo and cognitive impairment. The sedative properties of baclofen limits its potential widespread therapeutic utility [Dario &amp; Tomei, 2004]. Accordingly, activation of GABAB receptors by PAMs is one of the prioritized medication treatment approaches for NIDA in response to the opioid crisis [Rasmussen et al, 2019].</p><p>For information on the nonclinical and clinical data of ASP8062, please refer to the [Investigator\u2019s Brochure].</p></div>",

            "text": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>An in vitro cytochrome P450 (CYP) identification study suggested that ASP8062 is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, while morphine shows no inhibitory effect on CYP3A in an in vitro study [Haaz et al, 1998]. Morphine is metabolized by multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferases [De Gregori et al, 2012; Sato et al, 2012; Court et al, 2003; Projean et al, 2003]. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of ASP8062 with opioids is considered to be low. Potential interaction such as opioid effects on respiratory depression is theoretically possible because both ASP8062 and opioids are centrally active [Pattinson, 2008].</p><p>For future studies in opioid use disorder (OUD) patients, ASP8062 will be coadministered with opioids, including standard medication-assisted treatments such as buprenorphine/naloxone. Among opioid receptors, the \u00b5-receptor is considered to play a role in the decrease in the respiratory response to hypoxia, resulting in a decreased stimulus to breathe and the development of apnea [Schiller &amp; Mechanic, 2019]. ASP8062 has not been observed to directly interact with opioid receptor [study 8062-PH-9005] and the preclinical DDI study [study 8062-PH-9055] between ASP8062 and morphine, a full agonist for opioid \u00b5-receptor, failed to find any pharmacodynamic (i.e., respiratory depression) interaction including general condition. This clinical DDI/safety study will provide relevant safety (particularly for respiratory depression), tolerability and pharmacokinetic data in order to assess the potential risk of ASP8062 coadministered with morphine, a full agonist for opioid \u00b5-receptor to support future studies in this patient population. The study was designed particularly to investigate if ASP8062 has any additive effect on top of morphine by instituting the sensitive measure of end tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), using a single morphine dose slightly above the highest approved individual morphine dose, but presumably still allowing room to detect potential additive effects of ASP8062.</p><p>A randomized, participant- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, single sequence study was chosen to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ASP8062 alone and ASP8062 in combination with a single dose of morphine sulfate, a full \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist. Participants will be randomized to treatment to reduce selection bias. Participants and the investigator will both be blinded to treatment to reduce bias in the measurement of the primary safety endpoints. Given the long pharmacokinetic t\u00bd of ASP8062 (approximately 60 hours), a single sequence study was chosen.</p></div>",

ASP8062 is a crystal, which is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol.</p><p>An estimated 2.1 million Americans had an OUD in 2017 [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018]. Overdose deaths due to opioid use have skyrocketed to over 47600 in 2017 [Scholl et al, 2018].

Through investigation of PGx by technologies such as genotyping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome-Wide Association studies, the relationship between gene profiles and a drug\u2019s kinetics, efficacy, toxicity or disease may be better understood. As many diseases may be influenced by one or more genetic variations, PGx research may identify which genes are involved in determining the way a participant may or may not respond to a drug.</p><p>OBJECTIVES</p><p>The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is exploratory. The objective of this research will be to analyze or determine genes of relevance to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and/or toxicity/safety and/or disease. By analyzing genetic variations, it may be possible to predict an individual participant\u2019s response to treatment in terms of efficacy and/or toxicity and/or disease.</p><p>PARTICIPANT PARTICIPATION</p><p>Participants who have consented to participate in this study will participate in the PGx substudy. Participants must provide written consent prior to providing any blood samples that may be used at a later time for PGx analysis.</p><p>SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE</p><p>Participants who consent to participate in this substudy will provide 4 mL sample of whole blood per Astellas\u2019 instructions. Each sample will be identified by the unique participant number. Samples will be shipped to a designated banking CRO as directed by Astellas.</p><p>PGx ANALYSIS</p><p>Details on the potential PGx analysis cannot be established yet. Astellas may initiate the PGx analysis if evidence suggests that genetic variants may be influencing the drug\u2019s pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety and/or disease.</p><p>DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES/DATA</p><p>All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following study database lock. If there is no requirement for analysis, the whole blood sample will be destroyed after the planned storage period. The participant has the right to withdraw consent at any time. When a participant\u2019s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be destroyed. The results of any PGx analysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will be retained at Astellas indefinitely unless otherwise specified by local regulation.</p><p>INFORMATION DISCLOSURE TO THE PARTICIPANTS</p><p>Exploratory PGx analysis may be conducted following the conclusion of the study, if applicable. The results of the PGx analysis will not be provided to any investigators or participants, nor can the results be requested at a later date. Any information that is obtained from the PGx analysis will be the property of Astellas</p></div>",

For studies for which a central laboratory is used, alerts will be generated by the central laboratory regarding moderate and severe liver abnormality to inform the investigator and study team. Participants should be asked if they have any symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary dysfunction.</p><p>Definition of Liver Abnormalities</p><p>Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN is as shown below.</p><p>Table 12 \tModerate and Severe Liver Abnormalities</p><table class=\"ich-m11-table\"><tr><td></td><td><p>ALT or AST</p></td><td></td><td><p>TBL</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Moderate</p></td><td><p>&gt; 3 \u00d7 ULN</p></td><td><p>or</p></td><td><p>&gt; 2 \u00d7 ULN</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Severe</p></td><td><p>&gt; 3 \u00d7 ULN</p></td><td><p>and\u2020</p></td><td><p>&gt; 2 \u00d7 ULN</p></td></tr></table><p>ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; TBL: total bilirubin; ULN: upper limit of normal</p><p>\u2020Samples taken simultaneously or within a maximum of 24 hours.</p><p>In addition, the participant should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for any of the following:</p><ul><li>ALT or AST &gt; 8 \u00d7 ULN </li><li>ALT or AST &gt; 5 \u00d7 ULN for more than 2 weeks </li><li>ALT or AST &gt; 3 \u00d7 ULN and\u2020 TBL &gt; 2 \u00d7 ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 (if INR testing is applicable/evaluated) </li><li>ALT or AST &gt; 5 \u00d7 ULN and\u2020 (TBL &gt; 2 \u00d7 ULN in participants with liver metastases) </li><li>ALT or AST &gt; 3 \u00d7 ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (&gt; 5%) </li></ul><p>\u2020Samples taken simultaneously or within a maximum of 24 hours.</p><p>The investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described above, may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring and follow-up.</p><p>Follow-up Procedures</p><p>Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly characterized by obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history, physical examination and clinical laboratory tests. The study site personnel are to complete the liver abnormality case report form (LA-CRF). Participants with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should be followed as described below.</p><p>Confirmed moderately abnormal liver function tests should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly, and then weekly or less if abnormalities stabilize or the IP has been discontinued and the participant is asymptomatic.</p><p>Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another etiology, may be considered an important medical event and may be reported as an SAE. The sponsor should be contacted and informed of all participants for whom severe hepatic liver function abnormalities possibly attributable to IP are observed.</p><p>To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, the investigator is expected to:</p><ul><li>Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Symptoms and new-onset diseases are to be recorded as \u201cAEs\u201d within the electronic data source. Illnesses and conditions such as hypotensive events and decompensated cardiac disease that may lead to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in obese hyperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic participants and may be associated with fluctuating AT levels. The investigator should ensure that the medical history form captures any illness that predates study enrollment that may be relevant in assessing hepatic function. </li><li>Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and special diets. Medications are to be entered in the electronic data source. Information on alcohol, other substance use and diet should be entered on the LA-CRF or an appropriate document. </li><li>Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. </li><li>Based on the participant\u2019s history, other testing may be appropriate including: </li><li><ul><li>Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agent</li><li>Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease</li><li>Other clinical laboratory tests, including INR and direct bilirubin </li></ul></li><li>Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. </li><li>Submit results for any additional testing and possible etiology on the LA-CRF or an appropriate document. </li></ul><p>Study Treatment Discontinuation</p><p>In the absence of an explanation for increased liver function tests, such as viral hepatitis, pre-existing or acute liver disease, or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the participant may be discontinued from study treatment. The investigator may determine that it is not in the participant\u2019s best interest to continue study treatment. Discontinuation of study treatment should be considered if:</p><ul><li>ALT or AST &gt; 8 \u00d7 ULN </li><li>ALT or AST &gt; 5 \u00d7 ULN for more than 2 weeks</li><li>ALT or AST &gt; 3 \u00d7 ULN and\u2020 TBL &gt; 2 \u00d7 ULN or INR &gt; 1.5) (if INR testing is applicable/evaluated) </li><li>ALT or AST &gt; 5 \u00d7 ULN and\u2020 (TBL &gt; 2 \u00d7 ULN in participants with liver metastases) </li><li>ALT or AST &gt; 3 \u00d7 ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (&gt; 5%) </li></ul><p>\u2020 Samples taken simultaneously or within a maximum of 24 hours.</p><p>In addition, if close monitoring for a participant with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory tests is not possible, study treatment should be discontinued.</p><p>Hy\u2019s Law definition: Drug-induced jaundice caused by hepatocellular injury, without a significant obstructive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10% to 50% mortality (or transplant).</p><p>The 2 \u201crequirements\u201d for Hy\u2019s Law are:</p><ul><li>Evidence that a drug can cause hepatocellular-type injury, generally shown by an increase in AT elevations &gt; 3 \u00d7 ULN (\u201c2 \u00d7 ULN elevations are too common in treated and untreated participants to be discriminating\u201d). </li><li>Cases of increased TBL (at least 2 \u00d7 ULN) with concurrent AT elevations at least 3 \u00d7 ULN and no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated ALP) or Gilbert\u2019s syndrome [Temple, 2006]. </li></ul><p>FDA Guidance for Industry titled, \u201cDrug-induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation\u201d issued by the FDA on July 2009:</p><ul><li>The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of 3-fold or greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (nonhepatotoxic) control drug or placebo. </li><li>Among participants showing such AT elevations, often with ATs much greater than 3 \u00d7 ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum TBL to &gt; 2 \u00d7 ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP). </li><li>No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and TBL, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre-existing or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed injury. </li></ul></div>",

Through investigation of PGx by technologies such as genotyping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome-Wide Association studies, the relationship between gene profiles and a drug\u2019s kinetics, efficacy, toxicity or disease may be better understood. As many diseases may be influenced by one or more genetic variations, PGx research may identify which genes are involved in determining the way a participant may or may not respond to a drug.</p><p>OBJECTIVES</p><p>The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is exploratory. The objective of this research will be to analyze or determine genes of relevance to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and/or toxicity/safety and/or disease. By analyzing genetic variations, it may be possible to predict an individual participant\u2019s response to treatment in terms of efficacy and/or toxicity and/or disease.</p><p>PARTICIPANT PARTICIPATION</p><p>Participants who have consented to participate in this study will participate in the PGx substudy. Participants must provide written consent prior to providing any blood samples that may be used at a later time for PGx analysis.</p><p>SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE</p><p>Participants who consent to participate in this substudy will provide 4 mL sample of whole blood per Astellas\u2019 instructions. Each sample will be identified by the unique participant number. Samples will be shipped to a designated banking CRO as directed by Astellas.</p><p>PGx ANALYSIS</p><p>Details on the potential PGx analysis cannot be established yet. Astellas may initiate the PGx analysis if evidence suggests that genetic variants may be influencing the drug\u2019s pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety and/or disease.</p><p>DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES/DATA</p><p>All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following study database lock. If there is no requirement for analysis, the whole blood sample will be destroyed after the planned storage period. The participant has the right to withdraw consent at any time. When a participant\u2019s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be destroyed. The results of any PGx analysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will be retained at Astellas indefinitely unless otherwise specified by local regulation.</p><p>INFORMATION DISCLOSURE TO THE PARTICIPANTS</p><p>Exploratory PGx analysis may be conducted following the conclusion of the study, if applicable. The results of the PGx analysis will not be provided to any investigators or participants, nor can the results be requested at a later date. Any information that is obtained from the PGx analysis will be the property of Astellas</p></div>",
