In the present study however where only a single daily 25 mg oral dose of ASP8062 will be administered for 10 consecutive days, there is no likelihood of a therapeutic effect. Given the safety profile of ASP8062 when administered to healthy participants, there appears to be relatively minimal risk to participants taking a daily 25 mg oral dose. The clinical unit has appropriately trained staff and required equipment available to treat participants presenting with both opioid withdrawal and morphine associated adverse events (AEs) including respiratory depression.</p><p>The risks of morphine immediate-release tablets are well known. Risks are mitigated in that only a single dose of morphine will be administered on day 10 following 10 consecutive daily administrations of ASP8062 [Morphine Sulfate Package Insert]. Risks are also minimized because the participants are confined at a clinical unit that has administered a range of opioids, including morphine. Side effects of opioids in general include respiratory depression, central nervous system depression and drowsiness, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, dependence, reduction of gastrointestinal motility, hepatitis with or without jaundice, allergic reactions, impairment in the ability to drive, orthostatic hypotension, elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure and intracholendochal pressure.</p><p>There is no expected benefit to the participants from the administration of morphine.</p><p>This will be the first study where a multiple daily oral dose of ASP8062 is administered in participants that will also be given morphine after the participants have reached near steady-state peak to trough exposures of ASP8062. Risks are minimized by confining participants in an experienced clinical unit testing the effects of approved medications or new chemical entities when combined with morphine. This study is also being conducted after the initiation of the phase 1b study examining a single dose of ASP8062 (60 mg) in participants also administered buprenorphine-naloxone at doses/exposures consistent with OUD standard of care. Continuous pulse oximetry and capnography for at least 8 hours will be employed on day 10 when ASP8062 is given with morphine so that the potential for respiratory depression will be noted immediately, and appropriate medical treatment may be given. Participants will also be monitored by experienced staff for signs of opioid withdrawal. Vital signs will be monitored daily from days 9 to 16 and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be monitored on day 10 to detect potential cardiovascular symptoms several hours postdose. AEs will be assessed daily throughout the study. Potential hepatic toxicity will be monitored with clinical laboratory testing on at least a daily basis from days 10 to 16 of the investigational period. &gt;</p></div>"

In the present study however where only a single daily 25 mg oral dose of ASP8062 will be administered for 10 consecutive days, there is no likelihood of a therapeutic effect. Given the safety profile of ASP8062 when administered to healthy participants, there appears to be relatively minimal risk to participants taking a daily 25 mg oral dose. The clinical unit has appropriately trained staff and required equipment available to treat participants presenting with both opioid withdrawal and morphine associated adverse events (AEs) including respiratory depression.</p><p>The risks of morphine immediate-release tablets are well known. Risks are mitigated in that only a single dose of morphine will be administered on day 10 following 10 consecutive daily administrations of ASP8062 [Morphine Sulfate Package Insert]. Risks are also minimized because the participants are confined at a clinical unit that has administered a range of opioids, including morphine. Side effects of opioids in general include respiratory depression, central nervous system depression and drowsiness, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, dependence, reduction of gastrointestinal motility, hepatitis with or without jaundice, allergic reactions, impairment in the ability to drive, orthostatic hypotension, elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure and intracholendochal pressure.</p><p>There is no expected benefit to the participants from the administration of morphine.</p><p>This will be the first study where a multiple daily oral dose of ASP8062 is administered in participants that will also be given morphine after the participants have reached near steady-state peak to trough exposures of ASP8062. Risks are minimized by confining participants in an experienced clinical unit testing the effects of approved medications or new chemical entities when combined with morphine. This study is also being conducted after the initiation of the phase 1b study examining a single dose of ASP8062 (60 mg) in participants also administered buprenorphine-naloxone at doses/exposures consistent with OUD standard of care. Continuous pulse oximetry and capnography for at least 8 hours will be employed on day 10 when ASP8062 is given with morphine so that the potential for respiratory depression will be noted immediately, and appropriate medical treatment may be given. Participants will also be monitored by experienced staff for signs of opioid withdrawal. Vital signs will be monitored daily from days 9 to 16 and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be monitored on day 10 to detect potential cardiovascular symptoms several hours postdose. AEs will be assessed daily throughout the study. Potential hepatic toxicity will be monitored with clinical laboratory testing on at least a daily basis from days 10 to 16 of the investigational period. &gt;</p></div>"

Morphine is metabolized by multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferases [De Gregori et al, 2012; Sato et al, 2012; Court et al, 2003; Projean et al, 2003]. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of ASP8062 with opioids is considered to be low. Potential interaction such as opioid effects on respiratory depression is theoretically possible because both ASP8062 and opioids are centrally active [Pattinson, 2008].</p><p>For future studies in opioid use disorder (OUD) patients, ASP8062 will be coadministered with opioids, including standard medication-assisted treatments such as buprenorphine/naloxone. Among opioid receptors, the \u00b5-receptor is considered to play a role in the decrease in the respiratory response to hypoxia, resulting in a decreased stimulus to breathe and the development of apnea [Schiller &amp; Mechanic, 2019]. ASP8062 has not been observed to directly interact with opioid receptor [study 8062-PH-9005] and the preclinical DDI study [study 8062-PH-9055] between ASP8062 and morphine, a full agonist for opioid \u00b5-receptor, failed to find any pharmacodynamic (i.e., respiratory depression) interaction including general condition. This clinical DDI/safety study will provide relevant safety (particularly for respiratory depression), tolerability and pharmacokinetic data in order to assess the potential risk of ASP8062 coadministered with morphine, a full agonist for opioid \u00b5-receptor to support future studies in this patient population. The study was designed particularly to investigate if ASP8062 has any additive effect on top of morphine by instituting the sensitive measure of end tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), using a single morphine dose slightly above the highest approved individual morphine dose, but presumably still allowing room to detect potential additive effects of ASP8062.</p><p>A randomized, participant- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, single sequence study was chosen to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ASP8062 alone and ASP8062 in combination with a single dose of morphine sulfate, a full \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist. Participants will be randomized to treatment to reduce selection bias. Participants and the investigator will both be blinded to treatment to reduce bias in the measurement of the primary safety endpoints. Given the long pharmacokinetic t\u00bd of ASP8062 (approximately 60 hours), a single sequence study was chosen.</p></div>"

ASP8062 is a crystal, which is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol.</p><p>An estimated 2.1 million Americans had an OUD in 2017 [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018]. Overdose deaths due to opioid use have skyrocketed to over 47600 in 2017 [Scholl et al, 2018]. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) data show that use of opioids can lead to neonatal abstinence syndrome [NIDA, 2019a] as well as the spread of infectious diseases like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis [NIDA, 2019b]. Medication assisted treatment with buprenorphine (with or without naloxone), methadone or naltrexone is the current standard of care, and has resulted in decreases in opioid use, overdose deaths, criminal activity and infectious disease transmission [Mattick et al, 2014; Schwartz et al, 2013; Mattick et al, 2009]. However, buprenorphine can induce withdrawal on first administration, has an overdose potential, induces withdrawal symptoms and a loss of tolerance on cessation, is also subject to abuse and diversion and can cause respiratory suppression. Buprenorphine\u2019s ceiling effect may limit its effectiveness in patients with ongoing opioid use [Bart, 2012].</p><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 5 (DSM-5) defines substance use disorders as a constellation of recurrent pathological cognitive, behavioral and physiological symptoms arising from the ongoing use of a substance. The DSM-5 has combined the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 4 categories of substance abuse and substance dependence under the single heading of substance use disorders, which is classified by severity based on the number of symptom criteria (out of a total of 11) that are met: mild (2 to 3 criteria), moderate (4 to 5 criteria) and severe (more than 6 criteria) [Hasin et al, 2013]. Different drugs produce different effects on the user, but important shared features include a dysregulation of brain reward pathways and an overactive brain stress system, which together reinforce use of the substance to achieve a pleasurable high, even if pursuing this high incurs great cost or negative consequences for the user.</p><p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter, activates 2 types of receptors: ionotropic GABA type A receptors [Olsen &amp; Sieghart, 2008] and metabotropic GABAB receptors [Bowery et al, 2002]. Studies with GABAergic drugs and drugs of abuse have indicated that the GABAB receptor mediates suppression of self-administration/craving across several drug modalities. Drugs triggering abuse act by enhancing dopamine release in the ventral tegmental, striatal, and prefrontal cortical areas of the brain. The effects of GABAergic compounds on decreasing drug self-administration and drug-seeking behavior act by either directly or indirectly decreasing dopamine release in the aforementioned brain areas [Filip et al, 2015]. GABAB agonists or PAMs have been found to attenuate opioid-, alcohol-, cocaine- and nicotine-seeking behavior [Augier et al, 2017; Vlachou et al, 2011; Franklin et al, 2009; Filip &amp; Frankowska, 2007; Paterson et al, 2004; Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2003b; Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2003a] and also attenuate the drugs of abuse-evoked changes during intracranial self-stimulation [Vlachou et al, 2011; Paterson et al, 2008; Slattery et al, 2005]. However, activation of GABAB receptors by orthosteric agonists such as baclofen induces side effects such as sedation, somnolence, excessive weakness, vertigo and cognitive impairment. The sedative properties of baclofen limits its potential widespread therapeutic utility [Dario &amp; Tomei, 2004]. Accordingly, activation of GABAB receptors by PAMs is one of the prioritized medication treatment approaches for NIDA in response to the opioid crisis [Rasmussen et al, 2019].</p><p>For information on the nonclinical and clinical data of ASP8062, please refer to the [Investigator\u2019s Brochure].</p></div>"

The study was designed particularly to investigate if ASP8062 has any additive effect on top of morphine by instituting the sensitive measure of end tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), using a single morphine dose slightly above the highest approved individual morphine dose, but presumably still allowing room to detect potential additive effects of ASP8062.</p><p>A randomized, participant- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, single sequence study was chosen to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ASP8062 alone and ASP8062 in combination with a single dose of morphine sulfate, a full \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist. Participants will be randomized to treatment to reduce selection bias. Participants and the investigator will both be blinded to treatment to reduce bias in the measurement of the primary safety endpoints. Given the long pharmacokinetic t\u00bd of ASP8062 (approximately 60 hours), a single sequence study was chosen.</p></div>"

ASP8062 is a crystal, which is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol.</p><p>An estimated 2.1 million Americans had an OUD in 2017 [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018]. Overdose deaths due to opioid use have skyrocketed to over 47600 in 2017 [Scholl et al, 2018]. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) data show that use of opioids can lead to neonatal abstinence syndrome [NIDA, 2019a] as well as the spread of infectious diseases like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis [NIDA, 2019b]. Medication assisted treatment with buprenorphine (with or without naloxone), methadone or naltrexone is the current standard of care, and has resulted in decreases in opioid use, overdose deaths, criminal activity and infectious disease transmission [Mattick et al, 2014; Schwartz et al, 2013; Mattick et al, 2009]. However, buprenorphine can induce withdrawal on first administration, has an overdose potential, induces withdrawal symptoms and a loss of tolerance on cessation, is also subject to abuse and diversion and can cause respiratory suppression. Buprenorphine\u2019s ceiling effect may limit its effectiveness in patients with ongoing opioid use [Bart, 2012].</p><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 5 (DSM-5) defines substance use disorders as a constellation of recurrent pathological cognitive, behavioral and physiological symptoms arising from the ongoing use of a substance. The DSM-5 has combined the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 4 categories of substance abuse and substance dependence under the single heading of substance use disorders, which is classified by severity based on the number of symptom criteria (out of a total of 11) that are met: mild (2 to 3 criteria), moderate (4 to 5 criteria) and severe (more than 6 criteria) [Hasin et al, 2013]. Different drugs produce different effects on the user, but important shared features include a dysregulation of brain reward pathways and an overactive brain stress system, which together reinforce use of the substance to achieve a pleasurable high, even if pursuing this high incurs great cost or negative consequences for the user.</p><p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter, activates 2 types of receptors: ionotropic GABA type A receptors [Olsen &amp; Sieghart, 2008] and metabotropic GABAB receptors [Bowery et al, 2002]. Studies with GABAergic drugs and drugs of abuse have indicated that the GABAB receptor mediates suppression of self-administration/craving across several drug modalities. Drugs triggering abuse act by enhancing dopamine release in the ventral tegmental, striatal, and prefrontal cortical areas of the brain. The effects of GABAergic compounds on decreasing drug self-administration and drug-seeking behavior act by either directly or indirectly decreasing dopamine release in the aforementioned brain areas [Filip et al, 2015]. GABAB agonists or PAMs have been found to attenuate opioid-, alcohol-, cocaine- and nicotine-seeking behavior [Augier et al, 2017; Vlachou et al, 2011; Franklin et al, 2009; Filip &amp; Frankowska, 2007; Paterson et al, 2004; Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2003b; Di Ciano &amp; Everitt, 2003a] and also attenuate the drugs of abuse-evoked changes during intracranial self-stimulation [Vlachou et al, 2011; Paterson et al, 2008; Slattery et al, 2005]. However, activation of GABAB receptors by orthosteric agonists such as baclofen induces side effects such as sedation, somnolence, excessive weakness, vertigo and cognitive impairment. The sedative properties of baclofen limits its potential widespread therapeutic utility [Dario &amp; Tomei, 2004]. Accordingly, activation of GABAB receptors by PAMs is one of the prioritized medication treatment approaches for NIDA in response to the opioid crisis [Rasmussen et al, 2019].</p><p>For information on the nonclinical and clinical data of ASP8062, please refer to the [Investigator\u2019s Brochure].</p></div>"

Morphine is metabolized by multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferases [De Gregori et al, 2012; Sato et al, 2012; Court et al, 2003; Projean et al, 2003]. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of ASP8062 with opioids is considered to be low. Potential interaction such as opioid effects on respiratory depression is theoretically possible because both ASP8062 and opioids are centrally active [Pattinson, 2008].</p><p>For future studies in opioid use disorder (OUD) patients, ASP8062 will be coadministered with opioids, including standard medication-assisted treatments such as buprenorphine/naloxone. Among opioid receptors, the \u00b5-receptor is considered to play a role in the decrease in the respiratory response to hypoxia, resulting in a decreased stimulus to breathe and the development of apnea [Schiller &amp; Mechanic, 2019]. ASP8062 has not been observed to directly interact with opioid receptor [study 8062-PH-9005] and the preclinical DDI study [study 8062-PH-9055] between ASP8062 and morphine, a full agonist for opioid \u00b5-receptor, failed to find any pharmacodynamic (i.e., respiratory depression) interaction including general condition.

In the 8062-CL-0005 study, the AUCs of 30 mg ASP8062 with tablet B formulation (provided as a 30 mg tablet) were approximately 10% higher than 30 mg ASP8062 with tablet A formulation (provided as a 25 mg tablet plus a 5 mg tablet) with the 90% CI within the standard bioequivalence limits (80.00, 125.00); Cmax was approximately 60% higher. With this finding, multiple doses of 25 mg ASP8062 with tablet B formulation will be proposed for future clinical studies for OUD. The predicted exposures after multiple doses of 25 mg ASP8062 are 1828 h\u2022ng/mL for AUC24 and 143 ng/mL for Cmax. These exposures will be comparable to exposures in the previous clinical studies and will not exceed mean exposure limit set in previous phase 1 studies (247 ng/mL for Cmax and 2339 h\u2022ng/mL for AUC24); which means exposures achieved in this study are expected to be pharmacologically active (as seen in 8062-CL-0003) and also safe and tolerated based on data from previous clinical studies in a total of 137 healthy participants and 95 fibromyalgia patients.</p><p>The single dose of 45 mg morphine sulfate is 1.5 times higher than the approved highest individual dose per package insert [Morphine Sulfate Package Insert]. This dose is equivalent to 30 mg oxycodone, which is 2 times higher than the recommended highest individual dose and considered to be sufficient to show a sign of \u00b5-receptor agonism. Cmax after a single dose of 45 mg morphine sulfate immediate-release tablet is expected to be close to the reported maximum serum morphine concentration after intramuscular administration of morphine chloride (0.15 mg/kg body weight) in which most participants showed depression of the ventilatory response, characterized by the slopes of the carbon dioxide tension ventilation curves [M\u00f8ller et al, 1982]&gt;</p></div>"

In the 8062-CL-0005 study, the AUCs of 30 mg ASP8062 with tablet B formulation (provided as a 30 mg tablet) were approximately 10% higher than 30 mg ASP8062 with tablet A formulation (provided as a 25 mg tablet plus a 5 mg tablet) with the 90% CI within the standard bioequivalence limits (80.00, 125.00); Cmax was approximately 60% higher. With this finding, multiple doses of 25 mg ASP8062 with tablet B formulation will be proposed for future clinical studies for OUD. The predicted exposures after multiple doses of 25 mg ASP8062 are 1828 h\u2022ng/mL for AUC24 and 143 ng/mL for Cmax. These exposures will be comparable to exposures in the previous clinical studies and will not exceed mean exposure limit set in previous phase 1 studies (247 ng/mL for Cmax and 2339 h\u2022ng/mL for AUC24); which means exposures achieved in this study are expected to be pharmacologically active (as seen in 8062-CL-0003) and also safe and tolerated based on data from previous clinical studies in a total of 137 healthy participants and 95 fibromyalgia patients.</p><p>The single dose of 45 mg morphine sulfate is 1.5 times higher than the approved highest individual dose per package insert [Morphine Sulfate Package Insert]. This dose is equivalent to 30 mg oxycodone, which is 2 times higher than the recommended highest individual dose and considered to be sufficient to show a sign of \u00b5-receptor agonism. Cmax after a single dose of 45 mg morphine sulfate immediate-release tablet is expected to be close to the reported maximum serum morphine concentration after intramuscular administration of morphine chloride (0.15 mg/kg body weight) in which most participants showed depression of the ventilatory response, characterized by the slopes of the carbon dioxide tension ventilation curves [M\u00f8ller et al, 1982]&gt;</p></div>"
