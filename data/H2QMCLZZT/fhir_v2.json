Effects on behavior are manifest within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment. The same studies have shown that 8 to 12 weeks are required to demonstrate effects on cognition and clinical global assessment. This study is intended to determine the acute and chronic effects of the TTS formulation in AD; for that reason, the study is of 26 weeks duration. Dosage specification has been made on the basis of tolerance to the xanomeline TTS in a clinical pharmacology study (H2Q-EW-LKAA), and target plasma levels as determined in studies of the oral formulation of xanomeline (H2Q-MC-LZZA). The parallel dosing regimen maximizes the ability to make direct comparisons between the treatment groups. The use of placebo allows for a blinded, thus minimally biased, study. The placebo treatment group is a comparator group for efficacy and safety assessment. Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c) Copyright \u00a9 2006 Eli Lilly and Company Clinical Study Protocol Document Page 10 Two interim analyses are planned for this study. The first interim analysis will occur when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 8 (8 weeks). If required, the second interim analysis will occur when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 12 (24 weeks). (See Section 4.6, Interim Analyses.)</p><p>Approximately 100 patients will be randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups. Previous experience with the oral formulation of xanomeline suggests that this sample size has 90% power to detect a 3.0 mean treatment difference in ADAS-Cog (p&lt;.05,  two-sided), based on a standard deviation of 6.5. Furthermore, this sample size has 80% power to detect a 0.36 mean treatment difference in CIBIC+ (p&lt;.05, two-sided), based on a standard deviation of 0.9.</p></div>"

A large-scale study of safety and efficacy provided evidence that an oral dosing regimen of 75 mg three times daily (TID) may be associated with enhanced cognition and improved clinical global impression, relative to placebo. As well, a dramatic reduction in psychosis, agitation, and other problematic behaviors, which often complicate the course of the disease, was documented. However, the discontinuation rate associated with this oral dosing regimen was 58.6%, and alternative clinical strategies have been sought to improve tolerance for the compound.</p><p>To that end, development of a Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) has been initiated. Relative to the oral formulation, the transdermal formulation eliminates high concentrations of xanomeline in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and presystemic (firstpass) metabolism. Three transdermal delivery systems, hereafter referred to as the xanomeline TTS Formulation A, xanomeline TTS Formulation B, and xanomeline TTS formulation E have been manufactured by Lohman Therapy Systems GmbH of Andernach Germany. TTS Formulation A is 27 mg xanomeline freebase in a 25-cm2 matrix. TTS Formulation B is 57.6 mg xanomeline freebase in a 40-cm2 matrix. Formulation E has been produced in 2 patch sizes: 1) 54 mg xanomeline freebase with 0.06 mg Vitamin E USP in a 50-cm2 matrix and 2) 27 mg xanomeline freebase with 0.03 mg Vitamin E USP in a 25-cm2 matrix. For a detailed description of the composition of   these formulations please refer to Part II, Section 14 of the Xanomeline (LY246708) Clinical Investigator\u2019s Brochure. For characterization of the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of xanomeline TTS Formulations A, B, and E, please refer to Part II, Sections 7, 8, and 10 of the Xanomeline (LY246708) Clinical Investigator\u2019s Brochure. Formulation E will be studied in this protocol, H2Q-MC-LZZT(c).</p></div>"

The patient\u2019s and caregiver\u2019s willingness to comply with 26 weeks of transdermal therapy should be elicited, and those patients/caregivers unwilling to comply should be excluded.  Upon enrollment at Visit 3, and on the morning of each subsequent day of therapy , xanomeline or placebo will be administered with the application of 2 adhesive patches, one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25 cm2 in area. Each morning, prior to the application of the patches, hydrocortisone cream (1%) should be applied to the skin at the intended site of administration, rubbed in, and allowed to penetrate for approximately 30 minutes. Thereafter, excess cream should be wiped away and the patches applied. The patches are to be worn continuously throughout the day, for a period of approximately 12 to 14 hours, and removed in the evening. After removal of the patches, hydrocortisone cream (1%) should be applied locally to the site of administration. Patches should be applied to a dry, intact, non-hairy area. Applying the patch to a shaved area is not recommended. The application site of the patches should be rotated according to the following schedule:</p><p>Patients and caregivers are free to select either the left or right site within the constraints of the rotation schedule noted above. Patches should be applied at approximately the same time each day. For patients who habitually bathe in the morning, the patient should bathe prior to application of new patches. Every effort should be taken to allow for morning administration of the patches. Exceptions allowing administration of TTS patches at night instead of in the morning will be made on a case-by-case basis by the CRO medical monitor. In the event that some adhesive remains on the patient\u2019s skin and cannot be removed with normal bathing, a special solution will be provided to remove the adhesive. Following randomization at Visit 3, patients will be instructed to call the site if they have difficulty with application or wearing of patches. In the event that a patch becomes detached, a new patch of the same size should be applied (at earliest convenience) to an area of the dermis adjacent to the detachment site, and the rotation schedule should be resumed the following morning. If needed, the edges of the patch may be secured with a special adhesive tape that will be provided. If daily doses are reduced, improperly administered, or if a patch becomes detached and requires application of a new patch on three or more days in any 30-day period, the CRO research physician will be notified.</p><p>If the daily dose is reduced or improperly administered in the 24 hours prior to any scheduled clinic visit, the visit should be rescheduled (except for early termination and retrieval visits). Patients must be instructed to return all used and unused study drug to the investigator at each visit for proper disposal and CT reconciliation by the investigator.</p></div>"

At Visits 3, 8, 10, and 12, ADAS-Cog, CIBIC+, and DAD will be administered. NPI-X will be administered at 2-week intervals either at clinic visits or via a telephone interview. Efficacy measures will also be collected at early termination visits, and at the retrieval visit. The neuropsychological assessment should be performed first; other protocol requirements, such as labs and the physical, should follow.</p><ul><li><ul><li>Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog): ADAS-Cog is an established measure of cognitive function in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. This scale has been incorporated into this study by permission of Dr. Richard C. Mohs and the American Journal of Psychiatry and was adapted from an article entitled, \u201cThe Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS),\u201d which was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Volume No.141, pages 1356-1364, November, 1984, Copyright 1984. The ADAS-Cog (11) and the ADAS-Cog (14): The ADAS-Cog (11) is a standard 11-item instrument used to assess word recall, naming objects, commands, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition tasks, spoken language ability, comprehension, word finding difficulty, and recall of test instructions. For the purposes of this study, three items (delayed word recall, attention/visual search task, and maze solution) have been added to the ADAS-Cog (11) to assess the patient\u2019s attention and concentration. The 14 item instrument will be referred to as the ADAS-Cog (14). At each efficacy visit, all 14 items will be assessed, and in subsequent data analyses, performance on the ADAS-Cog (14) and performance on the subset ADAS-Cog (11) will be considered. </li><li>Video-referenced Clinician\u2019s Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC+): The CIBIC+ is an assessment of the global clinical status relative to baseline. The CIBIC+ used in this study is derived from the Clinical Global Impression of Change, an instrument in the public domain, developed by the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Study Units Program (1 U01 AG10483; Leon Thal, Principal Investigator). The instrument employs semi-structured interviews with the patient and caregiver, to assess mental/cognitive state, behavior, and function. These domains are not individually scored, but rather are aggregated in the assignment of a global numeric score on a 1 to 7 scale (1 = marked improvement; 4 = no change; and 7 = marked worsening). The clinician assessing CIBIC+ will have at least one year of experience with the instrument and will remain blinded to all other efficacy and safety measures. </li><li>Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X): The NPI-X is an assessment of change in psychopathology in patients with dementia. The NPI-X is administered to the designated caregiver. This instrument has been revised from its original version (Cummings et al. 1994) and incorporated into this study with the permission of Dr. Jeffrey L. Cummings. </li><li>Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD): The DAD is used to assess functional abilities of activities of daily living (ADL) in individuals with cognitive impairment. This scale has been revised and incorporated into this study by permission of Louise Gauthier, M.Sc., and Dr. Isabelle Gelinas. The DAD is administered to the designated caregiver. </li></ul></li></ul><p>For each instrument, each assessment is to be performed by the same trained health care professional. If circumstances preclude meeting this requirement, the situation is to be documented on the Clinical Report Form (CRF), and the CRO research physician is to be notified.   In addition to the efficacy measures noted above, a survey form will be used to collect information from the caregiver on TTS acceptability (Attachment LZZT.9).</p></div>"

Although every effort will be made to obtain the entire 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording, this may not always be feasible because of patient behavior or technical difficulties. The minimal recording period for an ambulatory ECG to be considered interpretable will be 8 hours, of which at least 3 hours must be sleep. </li><li>The incidence of syncope, defined as an observed loss of consciousness and muscle tone not attributable to transient ischemic attack or to seizure, will be closely monitored. Caregivers will be instructed to report any instance of syncopal episodes to the investigator within 24 hours. The investigator should immediately report such events to the CRO research physician. The CRO research physician will make a clinical assessment of each episode, and with the investigator determine if continuation of therapy is appropriate. These findings will be reported to the Lilly research physician immediately.</li><li>The CRO research physician will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study. Cardiovascular measures, including ECGs and 24-hour Ambulatory ECGs (see Section 3.9.3.4.2) will be monitored on an ongoing basis as follows: </li><li>As noted in Section 3.9.3.4.2, all patients will be screened by obtaining a 12-lead ECG, and will have repeat ECGs performed at Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and early termination (ET) (see Schedule of Events for Protocol H2Q-MC-LZZT(c), Attachment LZZT.1). ECG data will be interpreted at the site and express mailed overnight to a central facility which will produce a report within 48 hours. The report will be forwarded to the investigator. At screening, the report of the central facility will be used to exclude patients according to criteria specified in Section 3.4.2.2. If, during the treatment phase of the study, review of ECG data (either at the site or at the central facility) reveals left bundle branch block, bradycardia \u226450 beats per minute, sinus pauses &gt;2 seconds, second degree heart block, third degree heart block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, or ventricular tachycardia at a rate of \u2265120 beats per minute lasting \u226510 seconds, the investigator, the Lilly research physician, the CRO research physician, and the cardiologist chairing the DSMB will be notified immediately, and discontinuation of the patient will be considered.</li><li>As noted in Section 3.9.3.4.2, all patients will undergo a 24-hour Ambulatory ECG at Visit 2 (prior to the initiation of study medication). Ambulatory ECG data from Visit 2 will be express mailed overnight to a central facility which will produce a report within 24 hours. The report will be forwarded to the investigator. If a report documents sustained ventricular tachycardia with rate &gt;120 beats per minute, third degree heart block, or sinus pauses of &gt;6.0 seconds, the investigator, the Lilly research physician, the CRO research physician, and the cardiologist chairing the DSMB will be notified immediately, and the patient will be discontinued. If any report documents sinus pauses of &gt;3.0 seconds or second degree heart block, the CRO research physician, and Lilly research physician, and cardiologist chairing the DSMB will be immediately notified and the record will be reviewed within 24 hours of notification by the cardiologist chairing the DSMB.</li></ul><p>In addition to ongoing monitoring of cardiac measures, a comprehensive, periodic review of cardiovascular safety data will be conducted by the DSMB, which will be chaired by an external cardiologist with expertise in arrhythmias, their pharmacological bases, and their clinical implications. The membership of the board will also include two other external cardiologists, a cardiologist from Lilly, a statistician from Lilly, and the Lilly research physician. Only the three external cardiologists will be voting members.</p><p>After approximately 75 patients have completed 1 month of treatment, the DSMB will meet to decide:</p><ul><li>If discontinuation of the study or any treatment arm is appropriate</li><li> If additional cardiovascular monitoring is required </li><li>If further cardiovascular monitoring is unnecessary</li><li>If adjustment of dose within a treatment arm (or arms) is appropriate. </li></ul><p>If necessary, this analysis will be repeated after 150 patients have completed 1 month of treatment, after 225 patients have completed 1 month of treatment, and after 300 patients have completed 1 month of treatment. Primary consideration will be given to the frequency of pauses documented in Ambulatory ECG reports. The number of pauses greater than or equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 seconds will be tabulated. Primary analysis will focus on the number of pauses greater than or equal to 3 seconds.</p><p>In the event of a high incidence of patient discontinuation due to syncope, the following guideline may be employed by the DSMB in determining if discontinuation of any treatment arm is appropriate. If the frequency of syncope in a xanomeline treatment arm relative to the frequency of syncope in the placebo arm equals or exceeds the following numbers, then consideration will be given to discontinuing that treatment arm. The Type I error rate for this rule is approximately 0.032 if the incidence in each group is 0.04. The power of this rule is 0.708 if the incidence is 0.04 for placebo and 0.16 for xanomeline TTS.</p><p>This rule has been used in other studies for monitoring spontaneous events with an incidence of less than 10%. This rule is constructed assuming a 2-group comparison with each group having a final sample size of 100. Unblinding which occurs during these analyses will be at the group level and will be documented.</p><p>The stopping rule based on Ambulatory ECG findings is as follows:</p><ul><li>If the number of patients experiencing a pause of \u22656 seconds in a xanomeline treatment arm relative to the number of patients in the placebo arm equals or exceeds the numbers in the following table, then that treatment arm will be discontinued. The Type I error rate for this rule is approximately 0.044 if the incidence in each group is 0.01. The power of this rule is 0.500 if the incidence is 0.01 for placebo and 0.04 for xanomeline TTS</li></ul></div>"

The ADAS-Cog (11) and the video-referenced CIBIC+ will serve as the primary efficacy instruments. Secondary efficacy instruments will include the DAD, the NPI-X, and the ADAS-Cog (14). The procedures and types of analyses to be done are outlined in Section 4.</p><p>The primary analysis of efficacy will include only the data obtained up to and including the visit of discontinuation of study drug. Furthermore, the primary analysis will not include efficacy data obtained at any visit where the study drug was not administered in the preceding</p><p>Efficacy measures are described in Section 3.9.1.1. As stated in Section 3.9.1.2, the primary outcome measures are the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ instruments. Because both of these variables must reach statistical significance, an adjustment to the nominal p-values is necessary in order to maintain a .05 Type I error rate for this study. This adjustment is described in detail in Section 4.3.5.</p><p>The DAD will be analyzed with respect to the total score, as well as the subscores of initiation, planning and organization, and effective performance. This variable is considered a secondary variable in the US, but is a third primary variable in Europe.</p><p>The NPI-X is a secondary variable. The primary assessment of this instrument will be for the total score, not including the sleep, appetite, and euphoria domains. This total score is computed by taking the product of the frequency and severity scores and summing them up across the domains. Secondary variables derived from the NPI-X include evaluating each domain/behavior separately. Also, caregiver distress from the NPI-X will be analyzed.</p><p>ADAS-Cog (14) and each of the 14 individual components will also be analyzed. In addition, a subscore of the ADAS-Cog will be computed and analyzed, based on results from a previous large study of oral xanomeline. This subscore, referred to as ADAS-Cog (4), will be the sum of constructional praxis, orientation, spoken language ability, and word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech.</p><p>Any computed total score will be treated as missing if more than 30% of the items are missing or scored \u201cnot applicable\u201d. For example, when computing ADAS-Cog(11), if 4 or more items are missing, then the total score will not be computed. When one or more items are missing (but not more than 30%), the total score will be adjusted in order to maintain the full range of the scale. For example, ADAS-Cog(11) is a 0-70 scale. If the first item, Word Recall (ranges from 0 to 10), is missing, then the remaining 10 items of the ADAS-Cog(11) will be summed and multiplied by (70 / (70-10) ), or 7/6. This computation will occur for all totals and subtotals of ADAS-Cog and NPI-X. DAD is a 40 item questionnaire where each question is scored as either \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d. The DAD total score and component scores are reported as percentage of items that are scored \u201c1\u201d. So if items of the DAD are \u201cnot applicable\u201d or missing, the percentage will be computed for only those items that are scored. As an example, if two items are missing (leaving 38 that are scored), and there are 12 items scored as \u201c1\u201d, the rest as \u201c0\u201d, then the DAD score is 12/38=.316. &gt;</p></div>"

Effects in the ANCOVA model will be the corresponding baseline score, investigator, and treatment. CIBIC+ will be analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with effects in the model being investigator and treatment. Investigator-by-treatment interaction will be tested in a full model prior to conducting the primary ANCOVA or ANOVA (see description below).</p><p>Because 3 treatment groups are involved, the primary analysis will be the test for linear dose response in the ANCOVA and ANOVA models described in the preceding paragraph. The result is then a single p-value for each of ADAS-Cog and CIBIC+.</p><p>Analysis of the secondary efficacy variables will also be ANCOVA. Pairwise treatment comparisons of the adjusted means for all efficacy variables will be conducted using a LSMEANS statement within the GLM procedure.</p><p>Investigator-by-treatment interaction will be tested in a full ANCOVA or ANOVA model, which takes the models described above, and adds the interaction term to the model. Interaction will be tested at \u03b1 = .10 level. When the interaction is significant at this level, the data will be examined for each individual investigator to attempt to identify the source of the significant interaction. When the interaction is not significant, this term will be dropped from the model as described above, to test for investigator and treatment main effects. By doing so, all ANCOVA and ANOVA models will be able to validly test for treatment differences without weighting each investigator equally, which is what occurs when using Type III sums of squares (cell means model) with the interaction term   present in the model. This equal weighting of investigators can become a serious problem when sample sizes are dramatically different between investigators.</p><p>For all ANOVA and ANCOVA models, data collected from investigators who enrolled fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group will be combined prior to analysis. If this combination still results in a treatment group having fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group, then this group of patients will be combined with the next fewestenrolling investigator. In the event that there is a tie for fewest-enrolling investigator, one of these will be chosen at random by a random-number generator.</p><p>The inherent assumption of normally distributed data will be evaluated by generating output for the residuals from the full ANCOVA and ANOVA models, which include the interaction term, and by testing for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test from PROC UNIVARIATE. In the event that the data are predominantly nonnormally distributed, analyses will also be conducted on the ranked data. This rank transformation will be applied by ranking all the data for a particular variable, across all investigators and treatments, from lowest to highest. Integer ranks will be assigned starting at 1; mean ranks will be assigned when ties occur.</p><p>In addition, the NPI-X will be analyzed in a manner similar to typical analyses of adverse events. In this analysis, each behavior will be considered individually. This analysis is referred to as \u201ctreatment-emergent signs and symptoms\u201d (TESS) analysis. For each behavior, the patients will be dichotomized into 1 of 2 groups: those who experienced the behavior for the first time postrandomization, or those who had the quotient between frequency and severity increase relative to the baseline period defines one group. All other patients are in the second group. Treatments will be compared for overall differences by Cochran-Mantel-Haentzel (CMH) test referred to in SAS\u00ae as \u201crow mean scores differ,\u201d 2 degrees of freedom.

The justification for this follows.</p><p>The statistical hypothesis that is tested needs to be consistent with the ultimate data-based decision that is reached. When conducting placebo-controlled trials, it is imperative that the drug be demonstrated to be superior in efficacy to placebo, since equivalent or worse efficacy than placebo will preclude approvability. Consequently, a one-sided test for efficacy is required.</p><p>The null hypothesis is that the drug is equal or worse than placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that the drug has greater efficacy than placebo. A Type I error occurs only when it is concluded that a study drug is effective when in fact it is not. This can occur in only one tail of the distribution of the treatment difference. Further details of the arguments for one-sided tests in placebo-controlled trials are available in statistical publications (Fisher 1991; Koch 1991; Overall 1991; and Peace 1991).</p><p>The argument for one-sided tests does not necessarily transfer to safety measures, in general, because one can accept a certain level of toxicity in the presence of strong efficacy. That is, safety is evaluated as part of a benefit/risk ratio.</p><p>Note that this justification is similar to that used by regulatory agencies worldwide that routinely require one-sided tests for toxicological oncogenicity studies. In that case, the interest is not in whether a drug seems to lessen the occurrence of cancer; the interest is in only one tail of the distribution, namely whether the drug causes cancer to a greater extent than the control.</p><p>Different regulatory agencies require different type I error rates. Treatment differences that are significant at the .025 \u03b1-level will be declared to be \u201cstatistically significant.\u201d When a computed p-value falls between .025 and .05, the differences will be described as \u201cmarginally statistically significant.\u201d This approach satisfies regulatory agencies who have accepted a one-sided test at the .05 level, and other regulatory agencies who have requested a two-sided test at the .05 level, or equivalently, a one-sided test at the .025 level. In order to facilitate the review of the final study report, two-sided p-values will be presented in addition to the one-sided p-values.</p></div>"

A well-known simple method is the Bonferroni method, that divides the overall Type I error rate, usually .05, by the number of multiple outcomes. So, for example, if there are two multiple outcomes, the study drug is declared to be effective if at least one of the two outcomes is significant at the .05/2 or .025 level.</p><p>However, when one has the situation that is present in this study, where there are 2 (or 3 for Europe) outcome variables, each of which must be statistically significant, then the adjustment of the nominal levels is in the opposite direction, that is upwards, in order to maintain an overall Type 1 error rate of .05.</p><p>In the case of two outcomes, ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+, if the two variables were completely independent, then each variable should be tested at the nominal \u03b1-level of .051/2 = .2236 level. So if both variables resulted in a nominal p-value less than or equal to .2236, then we would declare the study drug to be effective at the overall Type 1 error rate of .05.</p><p>We expect these two outcome measures to be correlated. From the first large-scale efficacy study of oral xanomeline, Study MC-H2Q-LZZA, the correlation between CIBIC+ and the change in ADAS-Cog(11) from baseline was .252. Consequently, we   plan to conduct a randomization test to combine these two dependent dose-response p-values into a single test, which will then be at the .05 Type I error level. Because there will be roughly 300!/(3 * 100!) possible permutations of the data, random data permutations will be sampled (10,000 random permutations).</p><p>Designate the dose response p-values as p1 and p2 (computed as one-sided p-values), for ADAS-Cog(11) and CIBIC+, respectively. The rejection region is defined as [ {p1 \u2264 \u03b1 and p2 \u2264 \u03b1} ].</p><p>The critical value, \u03b1, will be determined from the 10,000 random permutations by choosing the value of \u03b1 to be such that 2.5% of the 10,000 computed pairs of dose response p-values fall in the rejection region. This will correspond to a one-sided test at the .025 level, or equivalently a two-sided test at the .05 level. In addition, by determining the percentage of permuted samples that are more extreme than the observed data, a single p-value is obtained.</p></div>"

The first interim analysis will occur when approximately 50% of the patients have completed 8 weeks; the second interim analysis is to be conducted when approximately 50% of the patients have completed 24 weeks of the study. The purpose of these interim analyses is to provide a rationale for the initiation of subsequent studies of xanomeline TTS, or if the outcome is negative to stop development of xanomeline TTS. The method developed by Enas and Offen (1993) will be used as a guideline as to whether or not to stop one treatment arm, or the study, to declare ineffectiveness. The outcome of the interim analyses will not affect in any way the conduct, results, or analysis of the current study, unless the results are so negative that they lead to a decision to terminate further development of xanomeline TTS in AD. Hence, adjustments to final computed p-values are not appropriate.</p><p>Planned interim analyses, and any unplanned interim analyses, will be conducted under the auspices of the data monitoring board assigned to this study. Only the data monitoring board is authorized to review completely unblinded interim efficacy and safety analyses and, if necessary, to disseminate those results. The data monitoring board will disseminate interim results only if absolutely necessary. Any such dissemination will be documented and described in the final study report. Study sites will not receive information about interim results unless they need to know for the safety of their patients.</p></div>"
